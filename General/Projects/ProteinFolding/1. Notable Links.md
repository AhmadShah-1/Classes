## 3. Protein design (the inverse problem)

**target shape → protein sequence that folds + binds**
This is the heart of what you’re asking.
### 🔹 Rosetta (the classic workhorse)
This is _huge_ in real labs.
Capabilities:
- De novo protein design
- Binder design to a target surface
- Interface optimization
- Antibody and nanobody design

Downside
- Steep learning curve
- Heavy compute
- Lots of parameters
But: **this is real, proven tech**.


#### RFdiffusion
- Diffusion model for protein backbone generation
- Can design binders to a target protein
- You specify:
    - Target surface
    - Constraints
- It proposes _entire new proteins_
This is one of the biggest breakthroughs in protein design recently.
