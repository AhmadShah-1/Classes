#### Melanin Prevention sorta:
- Nila Powder


#### Melanin Inhibition:

##### Foods:
- **Glutathione**: A potent antioxidant found in avocados, broccoli, and spinach that can shift melanin production from darker eumelanin to lighter pheomelanin.
- **Vitamin E**: Found in nuts and seeds, it protects melanocytes from oxidative damage and may inhibit tyrosinase.
- **Lycopene**: Found in tomatoes and watermelon, it acts as a "natural sunscreen" to resist UV damage that triggers melanin production.

##### Topical Agents:
- **Hydroquinone**: Often considered the "gold standard" for treating hyperpigmentation, it inhibits tyrosinase activity and can decrease the number of melanocytes. It is typically used in concentrations of 2% (OTC) to 4% (prescription).
- **Kojic Acid**: A natural byproduct of fungal fermentation that blocks tyrosine production, effectively reducing melanin synthesis.
- **Retinoids**: Derivatives of Vitamin A (like retinol and tretinoin) that accelerate cell turnover, helping to shed pigmented cells and disperse melanin more evenly.
- **Azelaic Acid**: Naturally found in grains, it inhibits tyrosinase and is particularly effective for post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation caused by acne.
- **Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid)**: An antioxidant that interferes with melanin production at the cellular level by interacting with copper ions at the tyrosinase active site.
- **Niacinamide (Vitamin B3)**: Unlike many inhibitors, niacinamide prevents the **transfer of melanin** from melanocytes to the surrounding skin cells, rather than stopping production itself.
- **Tranexamic Acid**: A newer option that reduces UV-induced pigmentation by inhibiting the plasminogen activation system in the skin.
