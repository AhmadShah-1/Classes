Quick sort  is better than merge sort as:
for merge sort we need to split every time, so its expesnive for space complexity
quick sort only needs the one array it has

However quick sort does not guarantee O(nlog(n)) time complexity

For heapify when checking if its sorted (All parents have higher values than the children):
- we only need to check from n/2 and upwards
