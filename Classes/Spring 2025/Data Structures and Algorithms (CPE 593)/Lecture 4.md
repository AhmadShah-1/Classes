The number of iterations that selection sort went through is still n-1
however unlike bubble sort, it has far fewer swaps
You cannot stop early in selection sort (unlike bubble sort)

The circled sectino is a max heap, which has a O(nlogn)

Repeat until the entire thing is a maxheap

Guaranteed the top of the heap is the largest number
cannot guarantee the order of the rest of the items
