3. Mathematical Foundations of AI
4. Applications of AI
5. Ethical Considerations in AI

## Detailed walkthrough following the original sequence:

### Key terms and definitions
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: The simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using it), reasoning (using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions), and self-correction.
- **Machine Learning (ML)**: A subset of AI that involves the use of statistical techniques to enable machines to improve at tasks with experience.
- **Deep Learning**: A class of machine learning based on artificial neural networks with representation learning.

### Concepts and principles
- **Types of AI**: 
  - **Narrow AI**: AI systems that are designed and trained for a specific task (e.g., facial recognition).
  - **General AI**: AI systems that possess the ability to perform any intellectual task that a human can do.

### Mathematical foundations of AI
- **Linear Algebra**: Fundamental for understanding data structures in AI, such as vectors and matrices.
- **Probability Theory**: Essential for making predictions and decisions based on uncertain information.

### Applications of AI
- **Healthcare**: AI is used for predictive analytics, personalized medicine, and robotic surgeries.
- **Finance**: AI algorithms are applied in fraud detection, risk management, and algorithmic trading.
- **Transportation**: Autonomous vehicles utilize AI for navigation and decision-making.

### Ethical considerations in AI
- **Bias in AI**: AI systems can perpetuate or even exacerbate biases present in training data.
- **Privacy**: The use of AI raises concerns about data privacy and surveillance.

## Summary of main points
- AI encompasses a wide range of technologies and applications, with significant implications across various sectors.
- Understanding the mathematical foundations is crucial for developing effective AI systems.
- Ethical considerations must be addressed to ensure responsible AI deployment.

## Practice problems
- **Problem 1**: Define the difference between Narrow AI and General AI.
- **Problem 2**: Explain how linear algebra is used in AI applications.
- **Problem 3**: Discuss the implications of bias in AI systems and propose potential solutions.
