    "#### Binary Trees\n",
    "A Binary Tree is a type of tree data structure where each node can have a maximum of two child nodes, a left child node and a right child node.\n",
    "\n",
    "This restriction, that a node can have a maximum of two child nodes, gives us many benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Algorithms like traversing, searching, insertion and deletion become easier to understand, to implement, and run faster.\n",
    "- Keeping data sorted in a Binary Search Tree (BST) makes searching very efficient.\n",
    "- Balancing trees is easier to do with a limited number of child nodes, using an AVL Binary Tree for example.\n",
    "- Binary Trees can be represented as arrays, making the tree more memory efficient.\n",
