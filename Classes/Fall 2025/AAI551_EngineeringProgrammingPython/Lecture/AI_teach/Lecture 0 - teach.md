# Introduction to Engineering Programming with Python

## Overview of topics covered
1. Required Textbook
2. Assignments
3. Exam Format

## Detailed walkthrough following the original sequence:

### Key terms and definitions
- **Required Textbook**: The course will utilize "Learning Python" by Mark Lutz, 6th edition. This book serves as the primary resource for understanding Python programming concepts and practices.

### Concepts and principles
- **Assignments**: Students will have both homework assignments and in-class assignments that will reinforce the material covered in lectures. These assignments are crucial for practical understanding and application of Python programming.

- **Exam Format**: The exam will be closed book and closed notes, meaning that students are not allowed to use any external resources or reference materials during the exam. Additionally, there will be no access to a Python shell, which implies that students must rely on their understanding and memory of Python syntax and concepts.

## Summary of main points
- The course will be based on the textbook "Learning Python" by Mark Lutz.
- Students will have homework and in-class assignments to complete.
- The exam will be strictly closed book and closed notes, with no access to a Python shell.

## Practice problems
