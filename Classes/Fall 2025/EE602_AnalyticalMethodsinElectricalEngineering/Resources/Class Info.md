### Assignment Submission
When assignments are due, they are due by 11:59 PM (EST) on the due date listed in the course schedule (due dates are usually on Fridays). The students are encouraged to use Latex (e.g., TeXstudio software or Overleaf online) for the assignments. Regardless of the word-processing software used (or if they are hand-written), assignments should be submitted in PDF form (if they are hand-written, use a phone camera-based scanning app to generate the PDF). An assignment PDF file should be appended by your username, such as “Assignment1_kim53.pdf". This makes it easier for me to manage assignment files when downloaded to my computer. Assignments received late up to a week will have 10% of the total points deducted for each late day. Assignments received more than one week late will receive no points. Assignments count for 30% of the total score.


### Exam
There will be a mid-term exam and a final exam for this course—each counts 30% of the total score. The final exam is slightly cumulative. Review sessions will be held the week before each exam, likely using Zoom to save class time.



### Assignment Grading and Participation
Students get marks for class participation - counts 3% of the total score. This is measured based on both the quality and/or quantity of the participation. Note that, beyond the conventional expectations of “participation” (e.g., asking/answering questions in the classroom), in this course, online discussion submissions and email conversations/verifications also count as valid modes of “participations.”

Students are motivated to complete their assignments and other submissions by the imposed deadlines. Students get marks for each on-time submission, which counts for 3% of the total score. Late submissions, irrespective of their lateness magnitude, will receive no points.
